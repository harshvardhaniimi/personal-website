  Advertising

subtitle: "We proposed a novel end-to-end approach, the Neural Lagrangian Selling (NLS) model, to improve Guaranteed Delivery (GD) advertising by concurrently predicting ad impression inventory and optimizing contract allocation. The model incorporates a differentiable Lagrangian layer and a graph convolutional neural network to enable direct optimization of allocation regret."
