**Central Limit Theorem App:** [app.R](https://www.harsh17.in/docs/demonstrating-shiny-apps/app.R)

Recently, I gave a presentation on R Shiny Apps to an FPM (PhD) class. Although the session was quite brief in itself, we developed a small central limit theorem demonstrator. It's not feature-rich or anything - just serves the purpose of seeing central limit theorem in action. Thanks a lot to [Prof Pritam Ranjan](https://sites.google.com/site/drpritamranjan/) for giving me this wonderful opportunity.

From [R Studio -- Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/):

> Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

In this small guest lecture, my purpose was not to demonstrate what to do with Shiny apps, as the uses are virtually endless. My goal was to leave them on a good pedestal so that they can pick it up as and when required. The clear thing about Shiny is its ease of use.

### Update on Feb 13, 2021

I delivered this guest lecture again for the next iteration of the course. This time, it was a full session --- I got 75 minutes to explain Shiny apps. I enjoyed it and the feedback was much better than last year.
