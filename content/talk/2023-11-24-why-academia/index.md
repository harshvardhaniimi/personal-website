It gave me a tonne of happiness in talking to IPM students on "Why Research?" at IIM Indore last week!

Thanks a tonne to Prof Ajit Phadnis who invited us for a panel discussion in his "Research Methodology" course.
I shared dais with Divyanshu Kukreti and Vanshika Chaudhary, learning from their research experiences and sharing mine.

Hope to see more IPMers thinking of research as a career option, a road less travelled in business schools.

Here are the slides:
