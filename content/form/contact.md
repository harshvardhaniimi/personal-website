description: "The best way to reach me is via emailing [harsh@harsh17.in](mailto:harsh@harsh17.in). I'm usually enthusiastic to talk about ideas, events and people -- in that order. If I don't respond within a week, another nudge is welcome. You can also try Twitter. The contact form is intentionally broken -- there are so many spam messages."
