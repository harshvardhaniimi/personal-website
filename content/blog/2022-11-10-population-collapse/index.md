Population collapse is a theory that says if trends continue to decline the way they are decreasing right now, we would reach population zero. It is a stage where the population neither grows, nor declines. That is, the number of births plus in-migrants equals the number of deaths plus out-migrants. While this may sound cheerful, you may not have considered the pitfalls yet. The smaller size of working adults would result in lower taxes and thus lower funds for welfare. The welfare that old and young desperately need.

But this blog is not about population collapse. I can recommend you some good starting points.

While I had learnt about this concept in college, I never thought it would be a reality. Until YouTube showed me this video.

One measure of population collapse, according to [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) at least, is the ratio of baby diapers sale to adult diapers sale.[^1] [Japan](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aging_of_Japan) is leading all the way while [China](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aging_of_China) is closely following it.

Sometimes it also leads to [innovative products](https://www.marketplace.org/2016/08/29/japans-changing-culture/):

> The company, she said, took into consideration that Japanese seniors, already petite by American standards, tend to become even more so with age. The average height of a Japanese woman, notes Yamanaka, is 157 centimeters (5 feet, 1 and a half inches), ‚Äúhowever, this senior citizen, 50s and 60s, the average height is 152 centimeters, (just under five feet), five centimeters shorter,‚Äù she said.

> ‚ÄúSo we make products which is more suitable for them ‚Äî this height. For example refrigerators and washing machines designed for them to easily take things out.‚Äù

> Because of their stature, products designed elsewhere can be inconvenient for a smaller Japanese population, requiring climbing or reaching to access wet clothes in a washing machine easily.

> ‚ÄúIn Japan, most people have backache,‚Äù Yamanaka said.

> In rural areas, many Japanese live in houses with two stories. And stairs. ‚ÄúAnd these people will clean up their house, stairs, holding up vacuum cleaners. And for them, the average weight, four kilo, was very heavy.‚Äù Almost nine pounds. So Panasonic created a lighter vacuum.

A few days ago, I was discussing this topic with a friend. She was concerned that her maid in New Delhi had too many children, beyond what she could support. Over population, especially if with the economically weaker section of population, can get pretty severe. However, I think this is a short-term view. I would prefer a [long-term view](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Longtermism). If the population growth rate keeps decreasing at its current pace, we can have problems.

# But seriously, the ratio of baby diapers sale to adult diapers sale?

I decided to look at the data for this. I found mixed results. The difference between sale of baby diapers and adult diapers vary between countries. The ratio is highest for Japan and Israel among the countries considered (see Table below). It is lower for younger countries like Brazil and India.

China‚Äôs case is slightly unique, that I don‚Äôt completely understand. If you do, tell me in comments.

### Japan üáØüáµ

> The glaring example is Japan, a country ageing really fast. The sale of baby diapers is growing at 10.2%, while adult diapers are growing at 8.1% ‚Äî quite close.

### United States of America üá∫üá∏

> Both are growing, but it is clear that adult diapers is growing faster. USA‚Äôs absolute sales volume is much higher for a country of 331 million.

### India üáÆüá≥

> India is one of the youngest countries right now. The baby diapers sale is increasing fast but adult diapers? Not so much.

### China

> I cannot understand China‚Äôs data well. Period.

### Russia

> I‚Äôve no clue if sales are increasing or decreasing ü§∑

# Data for 2021

The sales of baby diapers and adult diapers for 2021. The data is sourced from [Statista](https://www-statista-com.utk.idm.oclc.org/outlook/cmo/tissue-hygiene-paper/united-states#revenue). If you need the data for all years between 2014 to 2027, let me know.

Thanks to the University of Tennessee, I have free access to Statista. Libraries are the best!
