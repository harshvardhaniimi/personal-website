Almost a six months ago Twitter announced a new subscription service called Twitter Blue. It is a paid subscription service that costs paying \$8 per month (or \$11 per month via mobile purchase). And that monthly fee is a relative bargain: Larger institutions will have to pay at least \$1,000 a month for verification.

One can sign up to get a blue checkmark, prioritised ranking in conversations, half ads, long Tweets, Bookmark Folders, custom navigation, Edit Tweet, Undo Tweet, and more.

Launching a half-baked service is not a news in the tech industry. However, for a uitility service like Twitter which has global users not having the Android version sounds like a bad idea. For instance, Twitter's largest market is India, an Android market. Plus, the prices are in dollars.

Seriously, who will pay â‚¹9,400 per year for a social media?

### Starting today, the original Twitter verification marks are gone.

On April 1, Twitter is set to strip away the legacy verification checkmarks from the platform in favor of the paid checkmarks associated with Twitter Blue subscriptions. Then starting April 15, the platform apparently will no longer promote non-paying Twitter Blue subscribers via its recommendation algorithm on the For You feed. (The inability to participate in the polls sucks.)

![On April 1st, we will begin winding down our legacy verified program and removing legacy verified checkmarks. To keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue.](images/ss1.png)

Notable figures and outlets, from LeBron James to the White House, have said they won't be paying for verification.

So, any Tom, Dick and Harry will have the blue checkmark but not the government agencies, celebrities, and influential figures. We're gonna see a return of "real" prefixes in profile names.

### Who uses Twitter Blue?

[Travis Brown](https://github.com/travisbrown/blue/) has collated data on Twitter Blue users from the launch.

> We compiled this list by combining two approaches. The first uses a Twitter profile scraper that is one of the components of the Hassreden-Tracker project, which was supported by Prototype Fund in 2022. The second involves searching the Twitter API for tweets by Twitter Blue subscribers, with queries designed to cover areas of the Twitter graph that the first approach may miss (for example non-English-language accounts).

I thought it would be interesting to see who are they. Here's the exploration! You can download the R Markdown from my website.

First, I will load the required libraries.

```{r}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
library(scales)

# my favourite theme
theme_set(ggthemes::theme_clean())
theme_set(ggtech::theme_tech(theme = "google"))
```

Reading in the data. Source: <https://github.com/travisbrown/blue>. Since it doesn't have column names, I will add it. Using `janitor`, I will clean the names. It's [clean_names()](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) function is an absolute blast. It converts `CAPITALS` and spaces to `small_letters_with_underscores`. Pretty standard.

```{r}
# reading in data
df = read_csv("/Users/harshvardhan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Personal/personal-website/content/blog/2023-04-01-twitter-blue/accounts.csv", col_names = FALSE)

# adding column names and using janitor to clean names
names(df) = c("Account ID", "Screen name", "Legacy verification status", "Follower count",
              "Date Blue Sub", "Time Blue Sub", "Sub Status")
df = janitor::clean_names(df)

df
```

Here's a brief detail on columns.

[^1]: I find it funny that Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter doesn't have the first account. Who got it? Some engineer in his team?

Let's dive in.

### Popularity of Twitter Blue

```{r}
df1 = df %>% 
  # add year and week to the data
  mutate(year = as.character(year(date_blue_sub)),
         week = as.character(week(date_blue_sub))) %>% 
  
  # join year and week with a W
  mutate(year_week = paste(year, week, sep = "W")) %>% 
  
  # grouping and summarising for plots
  group_by(year_week) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # adding rounded labels
  mutate(lab = round(count / 1000)) %>% 
  mutate(lab = paste0(lab, "k"))

df1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year_week, y = count, label = lab)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.7, fill = "#1DA1F2") +
  geom_text(vjust = -0.2, size = 4) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Year and Week", y = "Number of New Subscribers",
       title = "Number of New Twitter Blue Subscribers") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18))
```

Twitter Blue added most number of users in the first two weeks of launch. The next peak is in the second week of 2023. What's that for? Tell me in comments, if you know.

### Who are the subscribers?

#### Blue Subscribers with Most Followers

The list of Blue subscribers is pretty interesting.

Here's the list of Blue subscribers with most followers. I am filtering only the users who are still subscribed to the service.

```{r}
# All Hail ChatGPT!
scale_cut = function(x)
{
  return(ifelse(x >= 1000000, 
         paste0(round(x/1000000), "M"),
         paste0(round(x/1000), "K")))
}

verification = function(x) {
  y = character(length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    if (is.na(x[i])) {
      y[i] = "Regular"
    } else if (x[i] == "V") {
        y[i] = "Verified"
    } else if (x[i] == "B") {
        y[i] = "Business"
    } else if (x[i] == "G") {
        y[i] = "Government"
    }
  }
  return(y)
}

df %>% 
  filter(sub_status == "B") %>% 
  select(screen_name, legacy_verification_status, follower_count, date_blue_sub) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = follower_count, n = 100) %>%
  mutate(follower_count = scale_cut(follower_count),
         legacy_verification_status = verification(legacy_verification_status)) %>% 
  datatable(colnames = c("Username", "Old Status", "# Followers", "Joined Blue On"))
```

Of the top-10 most popular accounts on Twitter, only Elon musk is the subscriber. This kinda speaks to the popularity of the service.

> [Top-10 Most Followed Accounts on Twitter, Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts)
>
> 1.  ElonMusk, 133M
> 2.  BarakObama, 133M
> 3.  justinbieber, 113M
> 4.  katyperry, 108M
> 5.  rihanna, 108M
> 6.  Cristiano, 108M

### How many followers do Blue subscribers have?

For this task, I am going to break down the follower count into smaller groups. Since most Blue subscribers do not have a huge fan following (Elon Musk, again, is an exception), it is a necessary step --- else, histograms wouldn't look relevant.

```{r}
x = df$follower_count

# Define the breaks for the bins
breaks = c(0, 100, 1000, 10^4, 10^5, Inf)

# Create a factor variable that represents the bins
bins = cut(x, breaks, labels = c("0-100", "100-1K", "1k-10k", "10k-100k", "100k+"))

table(bins)

bins = na.omit(bins)

ggplot(tibble(bins), aes(x = bins)) +
  geom_histogram(stat="count") +
  labs(x = "Follower counts", y = "Number of Blue Subscribers",
       title = "Number of Followers for Blue Subscribers") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14))
```

Holy moly, less than 5% of all Blue subscribers are "celebrities" on Twitter. So many have fewer than 100 followers. How many of them are bots!?

### Types of Accounts: Business, Government and Society

```{r}
df2 = df %>% 
  # add year and week to the data
  mutate(year = as.character(year(date_blue_sub)),
         month = as.character(month(date_blue_sub))) %>% 
  
  # join year and month with a M
  mutate(year_month = paste(year, month, sep = "M")) %>% 
  
  # grouping and summarising for plots
  group_by(year_month, legacy_verification_status) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(legacy_verification_status = verification(legacy_verification_status))

df2

ggplot(df2, aes(x = year_month, y = count, fill = legacy_verification_status)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Year Month", y = "New Blue Subscribers")
```

It feels like almost all the subscribers are Musk fanboys. There are almost no government accounts, very little business accounts and a few celebrities (who probably wanted to try the Blue service).

### How many of the original Blue Subscribers are still using it?

The data has a column called `sub_status` which has this detail.

```{r}
sub_status_change = function(x) {
  y = character(length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    if (is.na(x[i])) {
      y[i] = "NA"
    } else if (x[i] == "B") {
        y[i] = "Still subscribed to Blue"
    } else if (x[i] == "U") {
        y[i] = "Unsubscribed to Blue"
    } else if (x[i] == "S") {
        y[i] = "Account suspended"
    } else if (x[i] == "D") {
        y[i] = "Account deactivated"
    }
  }
  return(y)
}

df %>% 
  mutate(sub_status = sub_status_change(sub_status)) %>% 
  group_by(sub_status) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(sub_status, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = " K", scale = 1e-3)) + # for thousands
  labs(x = "", y = "Count",
       title = "Status of Original Twitter Blue Subscribers") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 4)) + 
  coord_flip()
```

### Conclusion

There was a huge influx of Blue subscribers after the service was announced. The momentum didn't last long. The subscriber addition rate fell down significantly, except in January when something extraordinary happened.

Out of the top-10 most followed accounts on Twitter, only Elon Musk himself has a Blue account. Some celebrities and businesses do have a Blue account but their group is dwarfed by regular Twitter Blue users.

Of the group that joined Blue, a good chunk (more than 30%) has left it already. This might be an underestimate given [Twitter is not actively removing verified badges](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-blue-subscriptions-lower) even after people stop the service.

What else do you find interesting? Tell me in the comments.
