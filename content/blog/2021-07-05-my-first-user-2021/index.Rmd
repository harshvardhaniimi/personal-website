This year, I am participating in [useR 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org), the R conference. It is my first conference so I expect to miss out on a few things but still hope to learn as much as I can. I am relatively free for the next week so learning as much as possible from the conference will be my central focus. Sadly, I didn't realise I had to register for tutorials separately â€” I thought one registration was all that's needed. I cannot attend the tutorials but it is likely that the authors would upload materials on their personal website, where I can pick up when needed. The complete session plan is [here](/docs/useR_2021_schedule.pdf).
