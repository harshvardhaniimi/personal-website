Names are precious and important representations of personality. The two-three syllables call out a person as to who they are, and if they are what they're supposed to be. For humans, the general convention is to have multiple names --- first, middle and last --- and for animals we seem to be adept with single names. For dogs, a Rottweiler Tommy is Tommy and so is a Doberman Tommy. They do not need or have family names as their human owners don't feel obligated to lend their names.

However, human names can still be weird. For example, Elon Musk called his child X Ã† A-Xii and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/entertainment/elon-musk-grimes-baby-name-pronunciation-scli-intl/index.html) has a guide to assist you with pronunciation.

But what happens when you grow up in a culture where last names are as fluid as first name, and there is no concept of middle name? Yes, I am from one of those culture --- and I'm not alone.

I was named Harsh at birth and Harshvardhan when I enrolled in school. No middle or last name. Others in my family had similar standing. My father's last name is different from my grandfather and grandmother. My mother's last name is different from maternal grandfather or grandmother. My mother didn't take my father's name after marriage. Like me, my brother has no last name. My sister's last name is different from my parents' and grandparents'.

Why?

I had the same question when people told me about the family names.

By taking up a name, you signal your belonging to a particular group which may or may not work in your favour, depending on the circumstances. Wouldn't be better to have higher degrees of freedom and allowing people to choose last name as well?
