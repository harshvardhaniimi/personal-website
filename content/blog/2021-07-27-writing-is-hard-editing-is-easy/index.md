Every time I write, I end up reading it sometime in future. That's obvious — if I won't read what I write, who else will — and is most accurate with this website. I have written most parts of it for my records, and I occasionally go over them to revise my learnings.

Looking back at old writings means finding a lot of errors, mostly grammatical errors. Though I resist the temptation to edit the already published articles, the pedantic me takes over and rewrites my mistakes. 

That is neither possible nor advised for academic publications. As it is called for corrections in academia, Erratum is typically used only for significant errors like calculation errors or misleading conclusions — not for trivial grammatical errors.

Perhaps that is why academic publications involve rounds and rounds of editing and review. One case study that I worked on went back and forth seven times, even though the editor accepted it after the first review. That experience and the number of minute errors the anonymous reviewer provided me were beneficial — not only for the case study but my writing in general.

If such is the case and an external reviewer for my website reviews and edits my website, my website will be full of red marks and corrections! I am not saying I haven't experienced any thoughts on my website — I have, and they're all positive! One stranger from Canada appreciated my Spotify data wrangling and visualisation. Several others over Twitter #rstats liked my Benford analysis on COVID data. There have been other positive comments too!

In his book "How to Write a Lot?" Paul Silvia beautifully addresses a lot of concerns around writing. One of the primary things he suggests is to allocate time to writing activities and not just writing. Writing activities include submitting the manuscript to a publisher, writing reviews, editing and polishing old writings, and of course, new scripts. Clubbing editing and writing together when marking a time in your calendar sounds simple but extremely helpful advice. 

When that time on the calendar becomes regular and a habit, it breaks the monotonicity of thinking and punching the keyboard. My brain usually recreates the sentence conveying the same idea when I read the original sentence. Often the revised article has better structure and organisation.

I started my website and blog in 2017. Initially, I hosted it as a WordPress website and purchased the domain (harshvadhan.xyz) from GoDaddy. The domain was relatively cheap for the first year but got seriously expensive soon. As a parsimonious student, I didn't renew my domain and moved on to Google Sites, which was free and surprisingly simple to get started. 

Eventually, I brought a new domain (harsh17.in) with Google Domains primarily because it assured me of a fixed yearly bill, which was cheaper in the long run. I was happy with my domain hosting, but there were severe limitations on things possible with Google Sites.

There were multiple inconsistencies within the site. I had few font choices for the complete website, but I had many options when editing a single page. Consequently, every blog post looked different. Sometimes when I copied something from a text editor and pasted it on-site, it retained the original formatting, sometimes it didn't. Pasting double spaced text from Microsoft Word worked even though there was no option to space text in Google Sites. Once pasted, I couldn't make it single-spaced! 

The biggest giveaway for me was the inability to host files on my site. I always had to upload them to Google Drive and then link it back after public sharing. This was not the ideal way of sharing files online. I wanted to have my CV available at a click and not ask everyone to log in to their Google account to have a look!

Sometime last year, I heard about Blogdown. I tried it twice and had failed both times — using so many systems together was confusing. Then Alison Hill's fantastic talk came up in my YouTube recommendations, and I followed the screencast step-by-step. I was up and running with Blogdown soon!

Soon after having the publishing part sorted, the question about content came up. I went through iterations of what I wrote and transported my old writings to the new website — providing new eyes to ancient writings (as old as 2016) and updating them. Minute changes that didn't alter the content except for correcting old mistakes.

I cannot invest in multiple reviews for my blog posts. Blog posts are the quick way of conveying ideas, and editing and reviewing them like a research paper would kill its joy. It is the place where I can be lucid and make mistakes. The best I can do is put them through a grammar check (Grammarly?) and reread if all makes sense. I hope my writing improves by the day, and someday even the first draft shines!
