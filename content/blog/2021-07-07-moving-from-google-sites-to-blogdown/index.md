I started blogging and having my web portfolio around four years ago — in 2017. In the beginning, I was hosting my website on WordPress and purchased the domain (harshvadhan.xyz) from GoDaddy. The domain was relatively cheap for the first year but got seriously expensive a year after that. So, I didn't renew my domain and moved on to Google Sites, which was surprisingly simple to get started. 

Eventually, I brought a new domain (harsh17.in) with Google Domains primarily because it assured me of a fixed yearly charge, which was cheaper in the long run. I was happy with my domain hosting, but I was getting frustrated with the things that I could not do with Google Sites over the years.

There were multiple inconsistencies within site. I had few font choices for the complete website, but I had many options when editing a single page.  Consequently, every blog post looked different. Sometimes when I copied something from a text editor and pasted it on-site, it retained the original formatting, sometimes it didn't. Pasting double spaced text from Microsoft Word worked even though there was no such option in Google Sites. Once pasted, I couldn't make it single-spaced! Ugghh...

But the biggest giveaway for me was the inability to host files on my site. I always had to upload them to Google Drive and then link it back after public sharing. This was not the ideal way of sharing files online. I wanted to have my CV available at a click and not ask everyone to log in to their Google account to have a look!

I had two inhibitions before moving to Blogdown and Netlify. I had tried it twice earlier and had failed both times — using so many systems together was confusing for me. I discovered Alison Hill's [fantastic talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RksaNh5Ywbo) and followed the screencast step-by-step. I was up and running with Blogdown soon! Second, I was afraid on losing the excellent Google Analytics tool and hundred free email aliases provided by Google. Turns out, I didn't lose any of them.
