## The Limitations of Artificial General Intelligence

> What is it that you see when you see? You see an object as a key, a man in a car as a passenger, some sheets of paper as a book. It is this word 'as' that must be mathematically formalised, on par with connectives "and", "or", "implies", and "not". ...Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem.

> By [Stanislaw Ulam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam), as cited in Bitwise: A Life in Code

Or, it may be possible but just not yet.

> It's like reverse engineering the latest Intel processor with only the basic knowledge of how a transistor works.

Yesterday, I met two guys from Micronesia. They spoke in broken English, and we could communicate little directly. I asked him how far Micronesia is from the US; he said he'd been here in the US for three years. How do you say "hi" in Micronesian?Â *Kaselehlie*. I had to Google this word; I didn't remember it at all. Why? The word is so unlike everything I've heard.

We build knowledge based on our existing knowledge. Every new piece of information needs to be connected to a part of currently existing knowledge. In some ways, this is how our neural networks work.

This picture from Obsidian, a note-taking app designed to arrange every new note related to a previous message based on a tag, conveys the idea practically.

Our current models either predict or classify. Either of these actions is not a complete representation of how human intelligence work. In fact, we are far away from understanding how human intelligence works!

# It feels like it's improving like crazy.

Someone trained an AI on personal journal entries of their younger self. The younger self and present self had a conversation.

Here is a rap battle between Tidyverse and base R built on [OpenAI's Chat](https://chat.openai.com/). It's beyond what I had imagined.
