## The Limitations of Artificial General Intelligence

> What is it that you see when you see? You see an object as a key, a man in a car as a passenger, some sheets of paper as a book. It is this word ‚Äòas‚Äô that must be mathematically formalised, on par with connectives ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚Äúor‚Äù, ‚Äúimplies‚Äù, and ‚Äúnot‚Äù. ‚Ä¶Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem.

> By [Stanislaw Ulam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam), as cited in Bitwise: A Life in Code

Or, it may be possible but just not yet.

> It‚Äôs like reverse engineering the latest Intel processor with only the basic knowledge of how a transistor works.

## How do we learn?

*Added on Sunday, July 17, 2022.*

Yesterday, I met two guys from Micronesia. They spoke in broken English, and we could communicate little directly. I asked him how far Micronesia is from the US; he said he‚Äôd been here in the US for three years. How do you say ‚Äúhi‚Äù in Micronesian?¬†*Kaselehlie*. I had to Google this word; I didn‚Äôt remember it at all. Why? The word is so unlike everything I‚Äôve heard.

We build knowledge based on our existing knowledge. Every new piece of information needs to be connected to a part of currently existing knowledge. In some ways, this is how our neural networks work.

This picture from Obsidian, a note-taking app designed to arrange every new note related to a previous message based on a tag, conveys the idea practically.

Our current models either predict or classify. Either of these actions is not a complete representation of how human intelligence work. In fact, we are far away from understanding how human intelligence works!

## If the parrots repeats the right answer, is it intelligent?

## Talking to your younger self

Someone trained an AI on personal journal entries of their younger self. The younger self and present self had a conversation.

### It can work in Hindi and Chinese as well!

Here is when I asked it to tell me the story of Buddha.

### Some other interesting chats with AI

![](images/How%20do%20I%20convince%20my%20friend%20that%20the%20earth%20is%20not%20round.png)

#### I asked it to write a story with soul in it

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young girl named Rose. Rose was a kind i p and gentle soul, who loved nothing more than to spend her days wandering through the lush green forests and fields that surrounded her home. She was always happiest when she was surrounded by nature, and she felt a deep connection to the earth and all of its creatures.

As she grew older, Rose began to develop a special gift. She could sense the souls of the animals and plants around her, and she could communicate with them in a way that no one else could. She would spend hours talking to the birds and the bees, the rabbits and the squirrels, and she soon became known throughout the land as the ‚Äúgirl with the soul.‚Äù

One day, as Rose was walking through the forest, she came across a beautiful deer. The deer was injured, and Rose could sense that its soul was in danger. She quickly tended to the deer‚Äôs wounds, and as she did, she felt a strong connection to the animal. She knew that she had to do everything she could to save the deer‚Äôs life. For many days and nights, Rose stayed by the deer‚Äôs side, nursing it back to health. She sang to it, talked to it, and even shared her food with it. Slowly but surely, the deer began to recover, and its soul started to shine once again.

Once the deer was strong enough to stand on its own, Rose said goodbye to her new friend and watched as it ran off into the forest. She felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that she had never known before, and she knew that she had found her true calling in life.

From that day forward, Rose dedicated herself to helping all of the creatures of the earth, and she became known throughout the land as a guardian of the soul. She spent her days traveling from place to place, bringing comfort and healing to all of the creatures she met.

And as she did, she discovered that the more she helped others, the more her own soul flourished and grew.

Rose lived a long and happy life, surrounded by the love and gratitude of all of the creatures she had helped. And when she finally passed away, she left behind a legacy of kindness and compassion that would be remembered for generations to come.
