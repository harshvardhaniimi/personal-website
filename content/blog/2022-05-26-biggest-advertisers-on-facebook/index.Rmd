[Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) provides data on [all ad funding](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report) related to social issues, [politics and elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_advertising). The database goes back to 2018 from the present. It tells how much each page has spent on advertisement and how many ads they have. It is part of Meta's effort to increase transparency in advertising.[^1]

[^1]: Twitter has banned all political advertisement on its platform, which isn't the best idea, if you ask me. Whether the platforms like it or not, general public reaches out to social media to learn about politics. Advertisements are one of the purest form of news as groups generally don't lie about themselves.
