<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If it takes less than 2 mins to do, do it now.</li>
<li><a href="http://carl.flax.ie/dothingstellpeople.html">Do things, tell people.</a></li>
<li>Build a model of everything. The model doesn’t have to be perfect but just better than a coin toss. Absorb the fact that you could be 100% wrong.</li>
<li>Choose what to believe in. There are good ideas in bad people’s brain; bad ideas in good people brain. As Gandhi said, <em>hate the sin not the sinner</em>.</li>
<li>Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.
<ul>
<li>Don’t be the best. Be the only.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.</li>
<li><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">Always demand a deadline.</a> A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.</li>
<li>Promptness is a sign of respect.</li>
</ol>
