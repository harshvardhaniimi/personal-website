Here are some interesting stats about my website. I would probably do this every year in the last week of May.

**All of these stats are for last three months, except the last one. The number of users is from 2019 to 2022.**

# I had 542 visitors and I was meeting 491 of them for the first time.

This is encouraging to know. This means my website is gaining audience rapidly. They also visited four pages on average.

# Most visitors were from US, almost 40%

Second most number of visitors were from India. Germany as third is surprising.

# Where's Ashburn?

Most visitors are from Ashburn. Where is that? Ashburn, Virginia? Ashburn, Georgia? And why are people from Ashburn so interested in my website. I'm curious...

# Surprise, surprise: Chrome is the most popular browser

Safari is second. (I love Safari, especially how beautiful it is. I do wish it handled extensions better to be honest.)

# Referral is getting me most visitors

My email signature is not that helpful, I guess. Organic search is great; Google's actually ranking me high enough to have an impact --- at least in some cases. The big daddy of all are Referrals. I want to see who are referring visitors to my website.

Practically, this is [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com) alone.

# Surprisingly, my Hindi blogpost is the most visited one in last one month

# The number of users has consistently increased over time
