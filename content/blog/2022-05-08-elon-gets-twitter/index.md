[Opinion \| Elon Musk Got Twitter Because He Gets Twitter - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/opinion/elon-musk-twitter.html)

> The man loves Twitter. He tweets as if he had been raised by the blue bird and the [fail whale](https://archive.ph/o/343qJ/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1987/fail-whale).

> Jack Dorsey, a Twitter co-founder and former chief executive, always wanted it to be something else. Something it wasn’t, and couldn’t be. “The purpose of Twitter is to serve the public conversation,” he [said](https://archive.ph/o/343qJ/https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jdorsey-090518.pdf) in 2018. Twitter began “[measuring conversational health](https://archive.ph/o/343qJ/https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation)” and trying to tweak the platform to burnish it. Sincere as the effort was, it was like those liquor ads advising moderation. You don’t get people to drink less by selling them whiskey.

[The Real History of Twitter, in Brief](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-twitter-3288854)

> Twitter began as an idea that Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey ([@Jack](https://twitter.com/jack)) had in 2006. Dorsey had originally imagined Twitter as an SMS-based communications platform. Groups of friends could keep tabs on what each other were doing based on their status updates. Like texting, but not.

# This one blows my mind.

It will go into textbooks for corporate communication failure, at least at business schools.

As such, we are strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day. Anyone who suggests otherwise is just wrong.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237580638859267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next, spam isn’t just ‘binary’ (human / not human). The most advanced spam campaigns use combinations of coordinated humans + automation. They also compromise real accounts, and then use them to advance their campaign. So – they are sophisticated and hard to catch.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237581419040768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some final context: fighting spam is incredibly *dynamic*. The adversaries, their goals, and tactics evolve constantly – often in response to our work! You can’t build a set of rules to detect spam today, and hope they will still work tomorrow. They will not.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237582211682304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially – are actually real people.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our team updates our systems and rules constantly to remove as much spam as possible, without inadvertently suspending real people or adding unnecessary friction for real people when they use Twitter: none of us want to solve a captcha every time we use Twitter.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237584623489024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now, we know we aren’t perfect at catching spam. And so this is why, after all the spam removal I talked about above, we know some still slips through. We measure this internally. And every quarter, we have estimated that &lt;5% of reported mDAU for the quarter are spam accounts.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237585441296385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our estimate is based on multiple human reviews (in replicate) of thousands of accounts, that are sampled at random, consistently over time, from *accounts we count as mDAUs*.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Each human review is based on Twitter rules that define spam and platform manipulation, and uses both public and private data (eg, IP address, phone number, geolocation, client/browser signatures, what the account does when it’s active…) to make a determination on each account.</p>&mdash; Parag Agrawal (@paraga) <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237587085463553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The use of private data is particularly important to avoid misclassifying users who are actually real.
