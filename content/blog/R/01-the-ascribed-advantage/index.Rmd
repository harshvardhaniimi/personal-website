How much more do men earn doing the same job as women? In this exploration, I will examine if the gender pay gap exists, in what jobs and how much is it. Specifically, this dataset is from United Kingdom. This dataset was part of #tidytuesday event and can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-06-28).

This online tool lets you [visualise](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/findoutthegenderpaygapforyourjob/2016-12-09) the difference by gender and occupation. If you're feeling brave, try this [quiz](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/testyourknowledgeonthegenderpaygap/2016-12-09) too.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)

ggthemr::ggthemr('dust')

paygap_raw = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-06-28/paygap.csv")

glimpse(paygap_raw)
```

The variables that actually look at the differences here are the variables that contain "diff" in their name. Let's look at those variables in detail.

```{r}
paygap_raw |> 
  select(contains("diff")) |> 
  datatable()
```

There are four variables. First two are differences in hourly pay (mean and median) and last two are differences in bonus (mean and median). The positive numbers have to be interpreted as men earning as much more than women in that company/organisation.

A useful variable is the [SIC code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-industrial-classification-of-economic-activities-sic), stands for standard industrial classification of economic activities. It identifies the business that the company is operating in.

```{r}
paygap_raw |> 
  select(contains("sic")) |> 
  datatable()
```

As can be noticed, some companies have more than one SIC code. Let's separate them with `seperate_rows()` function from `tidyr`. Then, let's count them to see which ones are the most common.[^1]

[^1]: I somehow keep forgetting about `count()` and end up grouping and summarising, which is a much more complicated way of achieving the same thing. Probably, I need to think of them as equivalent to pandas' `value_counts()` .

```{r}
paygap_raw |>  
  select(sic_codes) |>  
  separate_rows(sic_codes, sep = ":") |> 
  count(sic_codes, sort = TRUE) |> 
  datatable()
```

But what do these SIC codes mean? Let's check out! The CSV file is available at UK government's [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-industrial-classification-of-economic-activities-sic).

```{r}
uk_sic_codes = read_csv("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527619/SIC07_CH_condensed_list_en.csv")
uk_sic_codes |> 
  datatable()
```

The variable name needs to be cleaned.

```{r}
uk_sic_codes = uk_sic_codes |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
uk_sic_codes |> 
  datatable()
```

# Visualise Differences

## Which companies have the highest differences?

```{r}
paygap_raw |> 
  slice_max(order_by = diff_median_hourly_percent, n = 10) |> 
  select(employer_name) |> 
  unique() |> 
  datatable()
```

J.C.B. is the only familiar name to me. Is the difference one of the highest because of the business it's involved in? Construction sector doesn't employ many women. (If you're curious why there are 16 names when I asked for top-10, it's because some companies/roles have equal pay difference.)

## Which companies have the lowest differences?

```{r}
paygap_raw |> 
  slice_min(order_by = diff_median_hourly_percent, n = 10) |> 
  select(employer_name) |> 
  unique() |> 
  datatable()
```

Some of these look like housekeeping companies.

## Distribution of Hourly Pay

Let's start by seeing distribution of median difference in hourly pay.

```{r}
paygap_raw |> 
  ggplot(aes(diff_median_hourly_percent / 100)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.5, 0.5), labels = scales::percent) +
  ylim(c(0, 10000)) +
  labs(x = "Difference",
       y = "Count",
       caption = "A value of 10% implies that men earn 10% more than women.",
       title = "Median Hourly Pay Difference")
```

There are a lot of companies that are on the positive side than they are on the negative side.

To proceed, I need to join the SIC code values to that data frame. Before that, I have to separate the SIC codes which can be separated using `:`.

```{r}
paygap_joined = paygap_raw |> 
  select(employer_name, diff_median_hourly_percent, sic_codes) |> 
  separate_rows(sic_codes, sep = ":") |> 
  left_join(uk_sic_codes, by = c("sic_codes" = "sic_code"))

paygap_joined |> 
  datatable()
```

Let's see how many unique descriptions are there for SIC codes.

```{r}
paygap_joined |> 
  count(description, sort = TRUE) |> 
  datatable()
```

Many of them are similar to each other. "General secondary education" is very similar to "Primary education" --- considering teachers as one group might be more meaningful for analysis.

This can be done using `tidytext` package. I'm not interested in stop words, I will remove them. There are also many missing descriptions; I'll remove them too.

```{r}
library(tidytext)

paygap_tokenized = paygap_joined |> 
  unnest_tokens(word, description) |> 
  anti_join(get_stopwords()) |> 
  na.omit()

paygap_tokenized |> 
  datatable()
```

Let's see the most common words.

```{r}
paygap_tokenized |> 
  count(word, sort = T) |> 
  datatable()
```

There are 848 words. Some of them are useless, like "activities, "n.e.c", "general" and "non". I'll remove them. If I'm going to build any useful model, 858 categories are not going to be useful for me. Let's reduce them to say 40 words and call that `top_words`.

```{r}
top_words =
  paygap_tokenized |> 
  count(word) |> 
  filter(!word %in% c("activities", "n.e.c", "general", "non")) |> 
  slice_max(n, n = 40) |> 
  pull(word)
```

Let's take the tokenised dataset, filter only the top words. Then, we will see how different jobs have differences in pays.

```{r}
paygap = paygap_tokenized |> 
  filter(word %in% top_words) |> 
  transmute(diff_wage = diff_median_hourly_percent / 100, word)
paygap |> 
  datatable()
```

Okay, now we are ready to analyse the differences.

# Comparing by SIC Codes

```{r}
paygap_joined |> 
  mutate(diff_wage = diff_median_hourly_percent / 100) |> 
  group_by(description) |>
  summarise(diff_wage = mean(diff_wage)) |> 
  arrange(desc(diff_wage)) |> 
  datatable()
```

What is factoring? I've never heard of it. Here's how the [website](https://www.siccode.co.uk/sic2007/code-64992) describes it.

> **SIC Code 64992: Factoring**
>
> List of activities classified inside the UK SIC Code 64992
>
> -   Debt purchasing
>
> -   Discount company (e.g. Debt factoring)
>
> -   Factoring company (buying book debts)
>
> -   Invoice discounting

Other top contenders are manufacturing, plumbing services, etc.

Let's visualise the difference. Who doesn't like pictures!

## Industries with highest (average) hourly median difference

```{r}
paygap_joined |> 
  mutate(diff_wage = diff_median_hourly_percent / 100) |> 
  group_by(description) |>
  summarise(diff_wage = mean(diff_wage)) |>
  slice_max(diff_wage, n = 30) |> 
  mutate(description = fct_reorder(description, diff_wage)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = description, y = diff_wage)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Industry SIC",
       y = "Percentage",
       caption = "A value of 10% implies that men earn 10% more than women.",
       title = "Median Hourly Pay Difference") +
  coord_flip()
```

## Industries with lowest (average) hourly median difference

```{r}
paygap_joined |> 
  mutate(diff_wage = diff_median_hourly_percent / 100) |> 
  group_by(description) |>
  summarise(diff_wage = mean(diff_wage)) |>
  slice_min(diff_wage, n = 30) |> 
  mutate(description = fct_reorder(description, diff_wage)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = description, y = diff_wage)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Industry SIC",
       y = "Percentage",
       caption = "A value of -10% implies that men earn 10% less than women.",
       title = "Median Hourly Pay Difference") +
  coord_flip()
```

The differences are lowest in services and manufacturing activities (factory work).

These industry classifications are confusing; they provide too specific detail.

Let's visualise the difference by words in description. Recall that we stored it in `paygap` data frame.

```{r}
paygap |> 
  group_by(word) |>
  summarise(diff_wage = mean(diff_wage)) |>
  slice_max(diff_wage, n = 30) |> 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, diff_wage)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = diff_wage)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9, size = 2) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Percentage",
       title = "Percentage increase in men's hourly wages compared to women's") +
  coord_flip()
```

> Education has the highest wage difference.

Let's see which has the lowest wage difference.

```{r}
paygap |> 
  group_by(word) |>
  summarise(diff_wage = mean(diff_wage)) |>
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, diff_wage)) |> 
  slice_min(diff_wage, n = 30) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = diff_wage)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9, size = 2) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Percentage",
       title = "Percentage increase in men's hourly wages compared to women's") +
  coord_flip()
```

> Management, business and transportation service businesses look like to have the least differences.

# The average is not enough. Let's fit a simple linear regression model.

I'm forcing the intercept to be zero as I'm only looking for the differences due to the word; else the difference should be zero.

```{r}
paygap_fit = lm(diff_wage ~ 0 + word, data = paygap)
broom::tidy(paygap_fit)
```

`ggstatsplot` package provides beautiful ways to present these results.

```{r}
library(ggstatsplot)

names(paygap_fit$coefficients) = str_remove(names(paygap_fit$coefficients), "word")

ggcoefstats(paygap_fit, output = "plot", sort = "descending", 
            stats.labels = FALSE, exclude.intercept = TRUE)
```

Primary education (and in general education) has the highest wage gap. Can any one explain that to me?

# But what about differences by industries?

I'll keep only top-30 industries and classify all others as "others".

```{r}
paygap_fit = paygap_joined |> 
  mutate(diff_wage = diff_median_hourly_percent / 100,
         description = fct_lump_n(f = description, n = 30)) %>%
   lm(diff_wage ~ 0 + description, data = .)

broom::tidy(paygap_fit)
```

Pictures!

```{r}
names(paygap_fit$coefficients) = str_remove(names(paygap_fit$coefficients), "description")

ggcoefstats(paygap_fit, output = "plot", sort = "descending", 
            stats.labels = FALSE, exclude.intercept = TRUE)
```

The difference is least in unlicensed cafes and restaurants, healthcare facilities and social work areas. That's something positive.

It's 12:59 am now and I'm sleepy. Probably will pick this up again some day.
