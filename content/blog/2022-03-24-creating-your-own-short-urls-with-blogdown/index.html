<p>A few days ago I shared my personal Zoom room link to a few people: <a href="https://www.harsh17.in/zoom" class="uri">https://www.harsh17.in/zoom</a>. The neatness of this in comparison to something like <a href="https://zoom.us/j/99672273048?pwd=eXV5R2pBR0FqNlBUWmtLdCt6THl3dz09" class="uri">https://zoom.us/j/99672273048?pwd=eXV5R2pBR0FqNlBUWmtLdCt6THl3dz09</a> was amazing. It had two immediate effects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sharing Zoom link wasn’t a tedious task anymore. I could type it anywhere from my memory.</li>
<li>People started taking my Zoom calls more seriously. I’d like to believe it was due to my content but the short URL certainly had an effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>How did I do it?</p>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a>.</p>
<p>R is amazing and can easily be extended to new functionalities. Blogdown is an R package for creating personal websites.</p>
<p>You can create your own set of URL redirects in Blogdown. Instead of typing long URLs, you can create your own custom short URLs of the form <code>yourwebsite.com/shorturl</code>.</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Go to your folder <code>/static/</code> located in your personal website folder. It may or may not have any content already. If you do not have that folder, create one right beside other folders such as <code>content</code>, <code>layout</code> and <code>themes</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personal website directory. Create a folder <code>static</code> here if you don’t have it already.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Open your text editor (Notepad in Windows and TextEdit in MacOS) and create a new file named <code>_redirects</code> with <strong>no extension</strong>. Your computer will tell you add an extension, ignore the warning and go ahead.</p>

</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Write your URLs there. Start with the short URL and then long URL with at least two tab spaces. See my example below.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-24%20at%203.28.59%20PM.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to leave appropriate space (at least two tabs) between the short and long URLs. Handle ‘<code>/</code>’ properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can have comments starting with <code>#</code>.</p>
<p>That’s all!</p>
<p>Commit your edits to Github and give it two minutes to deploy via Netlify. Try your short URL and it should work.</p>

<h1>Some Tips</h1>
<p>Create short URLs for articles or website you frequently share or visit. For example, I have created short URLs for my social media profiles because twitter.com would take me to the home page instead of profile page.</p>
<p>Create a short URL for your Zoom room link. This one is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Create short URLs for content you share often. I frequently share link to my <a href="https://www.harsh17.in/next">Newsletter</a> and my article on <a href="https://www.harsh17.in/ipm">IPM admissions</a>. So, I created their short URLs that I can type as I go.</p>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Here are some tips in case you run into some troubles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure you leave at least two tab spaces between short URL and long URL.</p></li>
<li><p><code>/</code> matter. See that you are using the right short URL with or without <code>/</code> at the end.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit to Github and wait for results. Netlify takes a few minutes to deploy your new site.</p></li>
