I recently moved to United States (USA or America as everyone calls it) for my PhD at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee. I do plan to write why I decided to start another degree versus working in a company but in this post, let me jot down my experience of the states.

Travelling during the COVID times is a major hassle as you have to worry about safety a lot. Though vaccinations are common these days and I am fully vaccinated, I can't say the same for all my fellow passengers. Airlines require and provide masks and sanitisers during travel but we all know its not enough. With these little risks, I left my home on July 20, 2021 to begin a new phase of my life.

Upon reaching US, I was surprised how people were so at ease with COVID. Maybe it was the high vaccination rates or just too much exposure to COVID-19 that made them so confident about handling COVID. I was shying away from crowds but the Americans didn't have that [reluctance](#masks-and-vaccination). Anyway, I reached Knoxville and my Airbnb on time.

In the next few paragraphs, I will write about a few uncanny things I learnt about USA. Some are cultural shocks, others are technological shocks.

### Masks and Vaccination

It was probably a smart decision by CDC to stop the mask mandate as its enforceablity is seriously dubious if the general population doesn't *think* its effective. However, the vaccine hesitancy really caught my eye. Unlike India where how many vaccines we had was the limiting factor on how many people were vaccinated, Americans chose not to get vaccinated despite easily available vaccines.

I had some tangential idea of it as India actually has one of the lowest vaccination hesitancy rates, but seeing it unfolding in front of my eyes was surprising.

Thankfully, with the fear of the Delta variant the vaccination rates are picking up in USA. (I still wonder if they should increase the gap between the dosages (for Pfizer or Moderna vaccines) to make them more effective.)

### Public Transport

Public transport in the states is not a popular option for travelling within United States. Within city transport systems do exist in major cities but their frequency of operation is surprisingly low. For traveling between states, you either have the option of bus services like Greyhound or taking a flight. Amtrack railways are only present in around thirty cities.

My experience with buses wasn't positive either. I booked a Greyhound bus from Knoxville, TN to Columbus, OH and the bus was seven hours late! The operator on duty shared it was due to acute shortage of drivers. [More on employment.](#employment)

The common medium of transport across US is a car. In my experience, most residents owns a car and use them as their primary transport — no matter the distance to cover. In India, we use cars for traveling within cities or between two cities if the timings of railways or buses aren't as per our convenience. Since public transport are an inferior alternative in US, cars are the end-all-be-all medium of travel.

Their absence is enraging in certain instances. For my new apartment, I needed to buy a some furniture but couldn't figure how to transport them from the store to my home. Everyone expected me to have a truck!? When I enquired how people move their furniture if they do not have trucks, they suggested me to check out U-Haul. U-Haul rented me trucks but I had to drive them myself. How would I know how to drive a truck!?

Why do they not have something like Blackbuck in India? If everyone has a car, why do they not have Blablacar? Why do they not have railways?

### Payments

Almost everyone has a credit card and that's how they pay for the services. However, if you are new in the system like I was and do not have social security set up yet, you cannot get a credit card. Further, credit card payments are not instantaneous and free. I had a habit of scanning the ubiquitious QR codes for payments and I expected the payment system to be free, fast and safe.

Recently Venmo and Cashapp became popular which is basically Paytm wallet that we had in India before 2014. However, you are still linked to one app only and cross-app transfers are not possible. Their best payment system is ten years behind the current payment system of India. Google had [recommended](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/google-writes-letter-to-us-federal-reserve-to-adopt-upi-like-payments-mechanism-draws-cheers-among-indian-entrepreneurs-7782441.html) Federal government to implement the Indian UPI-like system in US. I hope they launch something like it soon.

### Food

Servings in US are more than a typical single meal. Unfortunately, there are no half-servings either. For $6.99, we get a plate full of food that you can eat once, pack, reheat and eat again, pack, reheat and eat again. However, I saw an obese American kid finish all that in a single meal!

I learnt that the servings are huge because many cannot afford to have three square meals and therefore aim to complete their daily calorie requirements with a single meal. Serving half of the food for half the price, and consuming them twice in a day would be a healthier alternative.

It is very easy to spot unhealthy food. McDonalds and Burger King are affordable and easy to find. However, fresh fruits, vegetables, salads, meat, etc. is much more expensive and elusive. How come fresh uncooked chicken is more expensive than a chicken burger!?

### Wastages

**Water: **The shower knobs in bathrooms cannot control the intensity of water flow; only the temperature. Guess the amount of water that's simply wasted during temperature adjustment or even during shower. 

**Electricity: **The electrical plugs do not have a switch for the socket. If its plugged in, its switched on. Imagine the electricity wasted because you didn't unplug your rice cooker or oven. In fact, certain equipments are never switched off at all!

**Plastics: **In India, I was charged for every single plastic bag to deter me getting them and using my own bags. In US, I brought five items and the shopkeeper gave me six bags — for free.

### Employment

Economic impact payment [may](https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-unemployment-labor-shortage-fed-51627664723) have some effect on it, but there are so many places looking for people to hire. McDonalds, Walmart, Aldi, or literally any place that requires humans for service is currently hiring. All this, while the unemployment is so high!

These shocks motivate me to go back to India, after learning the best practices from here. I have deeply believed India is the future and would be the place where the world would look up to in the next decade. All these only make my conviction stronger.

Of course, the list isn't complete and I will add more ideas!
