<p>Two days back I got curious about the Twitter API. I worked with a few APIs (using R) in the past but had never chanced upon using Twitter data. Additionally, Twitter provided a rich source of “what people are talking about”. I searched and found a very easy to use package for R called <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/">rTweet</a>. This package’s simplicity and easiness blew my mind.</p>
<p>I went deep into it and found several useful functions like <code>search_tweets()</code>, <code>stream_tweets()</code> and <code>get_timeline()</code>. Of course, there are many more functions, have a look at their <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/reference/index.html">reference list</a>.</p>
<p>But, why just stop there? <code>tidytext</code> allows very easy to use unigram sentiment analysis. I thought of finding the “positive” and “negative” words used on Twitter.</p>
<p>To start with, I tracked Kerala’s elephant murder: an incident in Kerala where an elephant died allegedly due to crackers blasting in its mouth. This incident had grabbed national and international attention bringing organisations like PETA to the forefront.</p>
<p>I first searched for last 10,000 tweets on Twitter, did some cleaning and finally analysed for sentiments.</p>
<div id="r-codes" class="section level2">
<h2>R Codes</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtweet) # Twitter API medium
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(dplyr) # for piping operator and handling tibbles
library(tidytext) # text mining libraries
library(textdata)

rt = search_tweets(&quot;Kerala+Elephant,lang:en&quot;,n = 10000, include_rts = F)

#clear all links
rt$updated_text = gsub(&quot;https.*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,rt$text)
rt$updated_text = gsub(&quot;http.*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,rt$updated_text)

#convert all texts to lowercase and remove punctuations 
rt2 &lt;- rt %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(updated_text) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, updated_text)

#removing stop words
data(&quot;stop_words&quot;)

#nrow(rt2)

rt2 = anti_join(rt2,stop_words)

#nrow(rt2)


# now, I&#39;ll attach each word to its sentiment using the dictionary &quot;bing&quot;
rt3 = rt2 %&gt;%
  inner_join(get_sentiments(&quot;bing&quot;)) %&gt;%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = T) %&gt;%
  ungroup()</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; panelset class=“greetings” &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Viz! :wave:” &gt;}}
<img src="images/Rplot.png" alt="positive and negative tweets about kerala elephant" />
{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Code :computer:” &gt;}}</p>
<pre class="r"><code># plot the negatives and positives
rt3 %&gt;%
group_by(sentiment) %&gt;%
top_n(20) %&gt;%
ungroup() %&gt;%
mutate(word = reorder(word,n)) %&gt;%
ggplot(aes(word,n,fill = sentiment)) +
geom_col(show.legend = F) +
facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) +
labs(title = &quot;Tweets containing Kerala and Elephant&quot;, y = NULL, x = NULL) +
coord_flip() +
theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; /panelset &gt;}}</p>
<p>Essentially, hardly anyone asked why the person did what they did. If it was even purposeful. Everyone just made a smiley face. A sad smiley face. :disappointed:</p>

<div id="why-stop-there" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Stop There?</h2>
<p>I thought of analysing the tweets by two world leaders: Narendra Modi (our PM) and Donald Trump (US President).</p>
<p>I only needed to get two different sets of tweets and the rest of code remained the same.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rt1 = get_timeline(&quot;realDonaldTrump&quot;, n = 10000, include_rts = F)
rt2 = get_timeline(&quot;narendramodi&quot;, n = 10000, include_rts = F)</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; panelset class=“greetings” &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Narendra Modi :shell:” &gt;}}
<img src="images/Rplot02.png" alt="Narendra Modi Tweets Positive" />
{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Donald Trump :statue_of_liberty:” &gt;}}
<img src="images/Rplot05.png" alt="Donald Trump tweets negative" />
{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; /panelset &gt;}}</p>
<p>Clearly, Modi uses many more “positive” words than Trump. Many of Modi’s negative words are also probably used in positive and hopeful sentences: poor, needy, etc. Trump’s characteristic with his fake (news). They both are using words associated with pandemic: virus, crisis, panic, attack, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s a proportion comparison of the overall sentiment.</p>
<p>{{&lt; panelset class=“greetings” &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Narendra Modi :shell:” &gt;}}
<img src="images/Rplot03.png" alt="Narendra Modi Tweets Positive" />
{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; panel name=“Donald Trump :statue_of_liberty:” &gt;}}
<img src="images/Rplot04.png" alt="Donald Trump tweets negative" />
{{&lt; /panel &gt;}}
{{&lt; /panelset &gt;}}</p>
<p>There’s a marked difference between how the two leaders - Narendra Modi and Donald Trump - tweet. Around 75% positive for Modi; 40% for Trump. Of course, I could go on comparing more but I exceeded the Twitter request and have to wait for another 15 minutes. Plus, my aim of basic understanding as to how to use API and unigram sentiment analysis was achieved.</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
