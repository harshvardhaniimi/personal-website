  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a student with a passion for solving analytical problems. I am excited about statistical modelling (statistics + coding) and have implemented [some techniques](/project/) to improve business decisions.

## Academics

I am studying in the [Integrated Program in Management (IPM)](https://www.iimidr.ac.in/academic-programmes/five-year-integrated-programme-in-management-ipm/) at the [Indian Institute of Management Indore](https://www.iimidr.ac.in). Effectively, I have completed my B.A. (Foundations of Management) and am currently enrolled in M.B.A. I was also an exchange student at the [University of Latvia (Latvijas Universitate)](https://www.lu.lv/en/) under the [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) grant during Feb-Jun 2019.

I completed my schooling at [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org) in 2016. I was awarded the Ministry of Defence, Government of India and Government of Jharkhand scholarships for seven years.

That is,
- MBA, IIM Indore [2021]
- Erasmus+ International Exchange, Latvijas UniversitƒÅte [2019]
- B.A. (Foundations of Management), IIM Indore [2019]
- HSC & SSC, Sainik School Tilaiya [2016]

## Skills and Interests

I like programming and solving problems through that. I started to code in C/C++, but over time picked up R. I know the basics of Java and HTML. R, these days, happens to be my go-to language. Apart from mathematics and statistics, I am also fond of philosophy, political economics and sociology.

Adventure sports are my thing. I've tried skydiving, para-sailing, paragliding, skiing, rock climbing, trekking, rafting, kayaking, hiking and more. I spend my leisure time [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23); you'll always find my Kindle around me. I love Calvin and Hobbes comic strip and consider it to be the single most relatable and ingenious work ever. 

I like listening to music, mostly Bollywood. My playlist of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f) is getting traction off late on Spotify. Do give it a try.
