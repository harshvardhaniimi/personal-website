  Hi there! Welcome to my [digital garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5ERSfydB30&t=1s).

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Here, you can find my academic [publications](/publications/), fun [projects](/projects/) I've tried, stuff I'd like people to [care](/talks/) about, some random [musings](/blogs/) and [notes](/notes/) on my favourite things. I don't have a Wikipedia, so you'll have to trust what I say here. 🐙

Recently, I started a weekly [curated newsletter](https://www.harsh17.in/next/) on data science and R: "Next --- Today I Learned About R". It's been loved by more than a hundred learners so far.
