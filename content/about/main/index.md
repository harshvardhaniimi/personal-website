  I am currently a doctoral student of Business Analytics and Statistics at the Haslam College of Business, [the University of Tennessee](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics), under the supervision of [Prof Sean Willems](https://seanwillems.com/).

  I completed my BA and MBA from [IIM Indore](https://www.iimidr.ac.in/academic-programmes/five-year-integrated-programme-in-management-ipm/) in April 2021. I was also an [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) exchange student at the [University of Latvia](https://www.lu.lv/en/) between Feb-Jun 2019. I completed my schooling at [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org/) in 2016.

  Solving real-world problems is my goal, and programming is my passion. Primarily, I code in R these days. I started coding in C++ and have light exposures to Java, C, SQL, HTML and Python. I am in love with statistics â€” which you are [free to call](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/new-blog-on-r-statistics-data-science-and-so-on/) analytics, data science, machine learning or whichever your favourite term is. Apart from mathematics and statistics, I am also fond of philosophy, political economics and sociology.
  
  In my free time, I [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23), participate in adventure sports, and lift my spirits with Calvin and Hobbes. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/6z25jqql0glx8o5aqhp8xkumr) has boosted how much I listen to music; my playlist of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f) is popular on Spotify.
