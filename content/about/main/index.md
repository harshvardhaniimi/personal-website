  I completed my BA and MBA from IIM Indore in April 2021. I was an [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) exchange student at the [University of Latvia (Latvijas Universitate)](https://www.lu.lv/en/) between Feb-Jun 2019. I completed my schooling at [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org) in 2016.
  
  I like programming and solving problems through that. I started to code in C/C++, but over time picked up R. I know the basics of Java and HTML. R, these days, happens to be my go-to language. Apart from mathematics and statistics, I am also fond of philosophy, political economics and sociology.
  
  Adventure sports are my thing. I've tried skydiving, para-sailing, paragliding, skiing, rock climbing, trekking, rafting, kayaking, hiking and more. I spend my leisure time [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23); you'll always find my Kindle around me. I love Calvin and Hobbes comic strip and consider it to be the single most relatable and ingenious work ever.
  
  I like listening to music, mostly Bollywood. My playlist of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f) is getting traction off late on Spotify. Do give it a try.
