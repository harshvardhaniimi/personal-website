  I’m an Assistant Professor of Information Systems and Analytics at the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu/) in the United Arab Emirates. My research focuses on forecasting, machine learning, and applied analytics. I attained my PhD in Business Analytics at the Haslam College of Business, [the University of Tennessee](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics), advised by [Dr. Chuanren Liu](https://datamining.utk.edu/). My [dissertation](https://blog.harsh17.in/phd/) explored enterprise demand forecasting using scalable machine learning algorithms. Alongside my PhD, I spent over a year interning with HP Inc. in their SPaM team, working on supply chain and demand forecasting projects.

  My academic journey began with a BA and MBA from the [Indian Institute of Management, Indore](https://www.iimidr.ac.in/academic-programmes/five-year-integrated-programme-in-management-ipm/), where I was advised by [Dr. Pritam Ranjan](https://sites.google.com/site/drpritamranjan/), graduating in April 2021. During this time, I had the opportunity to be an [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) scholar at the [University of Latvia](https://www.lu.lv/en/) for a semester. [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org/) shaped much of who I am today.

  When I’m not neck-deep in data, you’ll often find me [writing](https://blog.harsh17.in/) or lost in the wonderful world of [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23). For an adrenaline rush, I love participating in adventure sports. And nothing lifts my spirits like a good Calvin and Hobbes comic! Music is my constant companion, thanks to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/6z25jqql0glx8o5aqhp8xkumr). You might enjoy my curation of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f)—it’s quite a hit on Spotify.
