  I'm a doctoral student in [Business Analytics and Statistics](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics/about/) department at the Haslam College of Business, [the University of Tennessee](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics), advised by [Prof ChuanRen Liu](https://datamining.utk.edu/). Alongside my studies, for over a year now, I've been delving into the world of forecasting with the Strategic Planning and Modelling team at [HP Inc](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HP_SPaM).

  My academic journey began with a BA and MBA from the [Indian Institute of Management, Indore](https://www.iimidr.ac.in/academic-programmes/five-year-integrated-programme-in-management-ipm/), advised by [Prof Pritam Ranjan](https://sites.google.com/site/drpritamranjan/), graduated in April 2021. During this time, I had the opportunity to be an [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) scholar at the [University of Latvia](https://www.lu.lv/en/) for a semester. [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org/) made me who I am.

  When I'm not neck-deep in data, you'll often find me [writing](/blog). Or lost in the wonderful world of [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23). For a good adrenaline rush, I love participating in adventure sports. And nothing lifts my spirits like a good Calvin and Hobbes comic! Music is my constant companion, thanks to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/6z25jqql0glx8o5aqhp8xkumr). You might enjoy my curation of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f), it's quite a hit on Spotify.

  I'd be thrilled to know what you think about my digital garden. Feel free to share your thoughts and feedback at [hello@harsh17.in](mailto:hello@harsh17.in). Let's connect!
