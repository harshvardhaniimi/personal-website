  I am currently a doctoral student of Business Analytics and Statistics at the [Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee](https://haslam.utk.edu). I completed BA and MBA from [IIM Indore](https://www.iimidr.ac.in/academic-programmes/five-year-integrated-programme-in-management-ipm/) in April 2021. I was an [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) exchange student at the [University of Latvia (Latvijas Universitate)](https://www.lu.lv/en/) between Feb-Jun 2019. I completed my schooling at [Sainik School Tilaiya](https://www.sainikschooltilaiya.org) in 2016.
  
  I like programming and solving problems through that. I started to code in C/C++, but over time picked up R. I know the basics of Java and HTML. R, these days, happens to be my go-to language. Apart from mathematics and statistics, I am also fond of philosophy, political economics and sociology.
  
  In my free time, I [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/66858367-harshvardhan?shelf=%23ALL%23), participate in adventure sports and lift my spirits with Calvin and Hobbes. I like Bollywood music and my playlist of [Classical Hindi Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n6mpS4UvR3bXIpF1mrTFX?si=1ff29dd310e44d8f) is quite popular.
