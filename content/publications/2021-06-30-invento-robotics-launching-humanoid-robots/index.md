Invento Robotics by Balaji Viswanathan is probably one of the most famous start-ups in the Indian robotics space. Their flagship robot Mitra was used at a high profile Global Entrepreneurship Summit in October 2017. This marketing case study is on designing their marketing plan. This research work was selected into The Case Center 2021 Competition in the Hot Topics category. Colloquially, this competition is known as the Oscars of case studies.

### Abstract

Based in Bengaluru, India, Invento Robotics (Invento) was a start-up that manufactured humanoid robots. In October 2017, Invento received a mandate to develop a humanoid robot to welcome India's prime minister and the US president's senior adviser at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit that year in Hyderabad. It was a high-stakes event for Invento; a positive reception to the robots would mean many leads for the company, while a negative response could mar Invento's reputation. While Invento's time had hitherto been spent on research and development, there was pressure for it to now determine an overall marketing strategy. It was imperative that Invento quickly crystallize ideas about its customers, product positioning, branding, pricing, distribution channels, and promotions.
