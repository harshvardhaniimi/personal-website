### Podcasts

-   **TED:** TED's novelty is not a secret.
    Watch it; you will indeed find an exciting idea.

-   **Talks At Google:** Each time, they invite a great person to share their ideas about unconventional topics.
    They are pretty brave --- not shying away from calling people who are critical about Google's activities.
    You may like to start with Yuval Noah Harari's episode.

-   **Make Me Smart:** Topics I love --- Economics and Technology --- mashed together.

-   **Planet Money:** This is an easy listen with unique insights with practical economics lessons and examples.

-   **Linear Digressions:** All about machine learning and statistics.

### Comics

-   **Calvin and Hobbes:** Calvin's view of the world represents an exciting, marvellous vision of the world around him. Hobbes is the perfect companion. Their journey is like two adults taking a world tour in children's body.
