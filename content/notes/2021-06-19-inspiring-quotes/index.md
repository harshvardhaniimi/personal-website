There isn't one quote that I love.
Euphemisms and quotes keep me lasting.
As Zig Ziglar said, "*People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily.*"

I would like to have a collection but keep procrastinating.
Starting today, I'll add new quotes, as "the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, the second-best time is now."

I also made a website using R-Shiny that scraps a random Wikiquote and puts it in a nice background.
