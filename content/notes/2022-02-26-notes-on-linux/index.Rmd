## Linux Ubuntu

I kept on installing and uninstalling Ubuntu, until I shifted to Mac. This list will help me keep my mind clear of small tricks involving Terminal, if I move again.

1.  Use `tls` for battery preservation.
2.  Use `gdebi` for Debian based installs.
3.  Install Dropbox, R, RStudio, TeXLive and Spotify. You'll need them.
