This is an extract from Chapter 6: Games Computers Play, Bitwise by David Auerbach.

> What is it that you see when you see? You see an object as a key, a man in a car as a passenger, some sheets of paper as a book. It is this word 'as' that must be mathematically formalised, on par with connectives "and", "or", "implies", and "not". ...Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem.
