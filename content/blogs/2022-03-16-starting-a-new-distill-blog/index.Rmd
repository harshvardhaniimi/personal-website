I am largely following through this blog by RStudio to understand the next steps.

# Github

The first step is to create a Github repository. I created [this repository](https://github.com/harshvardhaniimi/next) for my newsletter. As you can see, there is a `readme.md` file, but it doesn't have any information. I will fill it up later.

# New Project

The next step is to create a new Distill blog project.
