Once I learned enough statistics, I realised that being true for most of the population doesn't mean it's true for all folks. Most algorithms are approximately wrong. Considering both these statements, all of what we know could be false. Improbable but not impossible.

Scientists considered everything that could've impacted our existence today to calculate our probability of existence. They considered the solar storm that made the earth, the asteroids that killed dinosaurs, the wars we all survived. The chance of us being alive today is one in four hundred trillion. That is, 1:400,000,000,000,000. With fourteen zeros. A perfect example of improbable but not impossible.

As Naseem Nicholas Taleb calls these black swan events are nearly impossible to predict. Everyone thought there were no black swans until someone caught them sunbathing in Australia. Algorithms are even worse in catching them. The over-reliance on prediction accuracy steals attention from their likelihood of happening and our confidence in them.

Then there are issues of reproducibility as well. Everyone is different from one another, and that's a universal fact. However, once in groups, this is much easier to model. I can't say if Sarah would eat from McDonald's today, but I know at least sixty million people will. Statistics and central limit theorem are great friends.

What about individual behaviour? That's too wild to predict. Or is it? Internet companies are doing it so well. Facebook and Google have personalised services just for me. But that's still based on group patterns. The system looks for users like me and tries to make me like them.

The real trouble is when we forget how inaccurate they are; when we fail to acknowledge their intelligence of a carrot and over rely on them. Situations like these result in false positives and fatal causalities. We need to provoke future statisticians and engineers on these relatively humane instincts. What do they think about it and why? The biggest lesson of education is not how to think but what to think.

Someday, when I teach the future stalwarts, a thought-provoking ethical question would be part of the exam. Everyone would get full credits but will have to answer thoughtfully.
