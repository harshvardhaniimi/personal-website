1.  If it takes less than 2 mins to do, do it now.
2.  Build a model of everything. The model doesn't have to be perfect but just better than a coin toss. Absorb the fact that you could be 100% wrong.
3.  Choose what to believe in. There are good ideas in bad people's brain; bad ideas in good people brain. As Gandhi said, *hate the sin not the sinner*.
