This summer was a fantastic experience for me. I spent three months toying with different machine learning models building large-scale forecasts for HP's print business. I went in with hardly a year of experience in Python. I came out with a deep understanding of how Python works, internally and visually. From textbook examples of regression and time-series forecasting, I went to creating forecasts for thousands of products that HP produces worldwide.

## Project

### Forecasting Demand

My internship project was on using machine learning to forecast the demand for printers worldwide. [Caroline Johnston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-johnston39/), my co-intern from the University of Southern California, and I created the models for better demand signal recognition. We developed models with [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.2/) and tuned them with [FLAML](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML).

HP manufactures and sells over 10,000 print-related products in over 170 countries. An accurate demand forecast is vital as demand forecasts drive supply planning. If we forecast higher than actuals, there is a cost of overage; if we predict too low, there is a cost of underage. We do not want too much inventory; we do not want too little, either.

Besides this primary project, we also worked on two other projects: recording data quality issues and designing holistic metrics.

### Recording Data Quality Issues

HP believes Data is an asset ([Curtland et al., 2022](https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2022.02.18/full/)). In 2021, the company gained the new imperative that values data as an asset and places a premium on data quality, access, and utility. This idea evolved from Data Science and Knowledge Discovery, an HP internal summit with 100+ presentations over three days.[^1]

    > Formalized in 2016, DSKD is composed of more than 3,000 members who hold biweekly knowledge sharing sessions and annual internal summits. The 2021 summit included 114 presentations over three days, culled from more than 500 submitted papers. Topics presented included proactive and predictive services, deep learning, reinforcement learning, data preparation and feature engineering, product improvement, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automation, mixed-integer time-phased optimization, business process automation and much more.

We created Python codes that identified the errors before they were fed into the model and logged them separately into a spreadsheet. The team could use this to fix the problems at the source.

### Designing Holistic Metrics

Businesses care about different metrics than machine learning models. For example, planners prefer to have a bit of extra inventory than too few units. The cost of overage is less than the cost of underage. However, the machine learning models' loss function is usually symmetric. RMSE, WMAPE, and almost every metric would treat $x$ units more similarly to $x$ units less.

We (largely Caroline) also designed holistic metrics to synthesise business and ML accuracy results. We worked on automatic data quality error detection.

## Team

I worked with the [Strategic Planning and Modelling](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HP_SPaM) team, abbreviated internally as SPaM.[^2] The SPaM team has an extensive experience in supply chain analytics. They have worked on several mission-critical projects over the last 40 years, and my task was no different. My manager, [Barrett Crane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrett-crane-a3a239/), and my project mentors, [Cara Curtland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caracurtland/) and [Jerry Hwang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-hwang-445191/), cared for us to succeed in the internship.[^3]

[^2]: The acronym was popular before spam emails became a problem. The word wasn't in general lingo back when HP SPaM was founded in 1989.

[^3]: Even today, there's rarely a meeting with Jerry where I don't learn something new about Python, Jupyter and ilk.

[Shawn Tay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stay/), another SPaMster, taught me ways to think about my career. He suggested that I look at my career as a project *consultant*. Currently, I'm working on a project with HP where I've to maximise my contribution so that the *client* would be happy and satisfied. In the process, I should aim to upskill myself continuously. A better consultant would get a better project, making them better consultants. It is a continuous improvement loop.[^4]

[^4]: I believe this idea comes from a book that either Caroline or Shawn mentioned, but I don't remember the name.

### Spreadsheet Modelling Workshop

The SPaM team in Vancouver also organised an Excel workshop where we learnt interactive spreadsheet modelling. I also got the opportunity to talk about data manipulation in the session!

## InternStellar Award

In the technical contribution category, our internship project got the first runners-up at the HP InternStellar Award competition.[^5] This is Caroline and me at the final poster fair for interns.

[^5]: The winner developed a method that could print on *any* fiber rather quickly. I'm perfectly fine with the second position; he deserved it.

## Fun continues...

I thoroughly enjoyed the work. The problem was intellectually stimulating, with no apparent answers. Therefore, I'm continuing the work through the school year, working part-time with them!
