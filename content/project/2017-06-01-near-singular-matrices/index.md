### Near-singularity of Gaussian Correlation Matrices

-   Understanding and establishing a quantified measure of near-singularity for correlation matrices
-   Influence of hyperparameters - design size, dimension and parameter - on near-singularity of correlation matrices
-   Possibilities of getting rid of near-singularity without compromising on original prediction accuracy
-   Learnt LaTeX from scratch for crafting reports and presentation related to this internship
