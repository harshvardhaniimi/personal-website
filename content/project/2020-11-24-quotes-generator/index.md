The aim was to make a quotes generator website which we take with our breakfast. I used SelectorGadget and rvest to scrap quotes from Wikipedia page. Then I used Unsplash API to get a random nature background image. Finally, I use Shiny to combine all of these and make a webapp out of it. Go, check it out!
