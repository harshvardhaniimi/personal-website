Recently, I came across [Brain Waves](https://choosemuse.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-brainwaves-brainwave-frequencies-explained-2/) that aid in learning, concentration or sleep. I created my own set of pure waves using R. They're [available](https://soundcloud.com/harshv17/sets) on Soundcloud for free.

Of course, it remains to test if these actually have an impact.
