# Abstract

Websites used to be developed by groups of people to meet the needs of other groups of people.Â **Today, as the internet grows more personalised than an encyclopedia of information, I argue we need more personal websites.**Â Social media platforms are limited and occupational in treating your content. Your message might be curtailed by what LinkedIn allows or 280 characters on Twitter. Academics, especially grad students, need it even more as few CV pages do not include most details.

**Contrary to many think, maintaining a personal website is neither difficult nor expensive.**Â Unfortunately, creating a website is approached as a "technology problem" to be solved. Projects are coloured from the beginning by enthusiasms for or fear for HTML, CSS and other fancy jargon --- when it doesn't have to be so.

In this talk,Â **I will discuss why academics should have a personal website. I will also guide you through designing a website and hosting it with a live hands-on example.**Â I will useÂ [Owlstown](https://www.owlstown.com/)Â for the demonstration.
