This workshop was organised by Syntax, IT Club of IIM Indore. I explained how LaTeX and Overleaf worked to undergraduate management students. While other templates were briefly discussed, the workshop used [Deedy CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz) for demonstrating LaTeX-based editing. Most participants had no prior exposure to LaTeX and thus I concentrated in building the foundations and then jumping to Resume. By the end of workshop, every participant had a Resume built for themselves.
