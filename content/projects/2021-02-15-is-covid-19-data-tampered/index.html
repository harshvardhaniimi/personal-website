<p>Are COVID-19 numbers reported by countries altered? I test the validity of COVID-19 new daily cases for every country using Benford’s Law. Since the pandemic gained global centre stage, there has been a surge in data manipulation accusations. Independent media agencies questioned country-level data, and all of us made our own conclusions if the data is correct.</p>
<p>Benford’s law tells us that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Take any naturally occurring dataset. If you count the frequency of the first digits, 1 appears around 30 per cent of the time, 2 appears for 18% of the time, …, and 9 appears around 5 per cent of the time. This amazingly simple “law” can be an authoritative proof to start an investigation — following natural justice, we shouldn’t call anyone guilty of manipulation just on this violation.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the digits’ occurrence probability can be modelled using Benford’s Distribution, with the following probability distribution function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(d) = \log_{10}(d+1) - \log_{10}(d) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{d+1}{d}\right) = \log_{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{d}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>The probability of each digit comes out exactly as the following.</p>

<p>The law is so universal that the Income Tax Department uses it to detect fraud, legal cases have admitted it as evidence, regulators analyse prices to see cartel-like behaviour, forensics use it to identify deep-fakes and doctored videos, among others, and in our case, COVID-19 data reported by countries. The Netflix TV-series “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12753692/">Connected</a>” did an episode “Digits” on Benford’s Law. It is absolutely brilliant and you should watch it.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>My approach is simple and direct. Using the COVID-19 data available at <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data">Our World in Data (John Hopkins University)</a>, I modelled each country’s daily cases using R and found first-digit distribution using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/benford/index.html">benford</a> package in R. I measured how much they differed from the expected proportion as Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE). A lower RMSE value would mean more accurate data reporting.</p>

<h2>As of May 23, 2021</h2>
<p>The countries with very little evidence of manipulation — RMSE less than 3 — are the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comoros, Somalia, Dominica, Republic of Congo, Vatican, Solomon Islands, United Republic of Tanzania, Samoa, Vanuatu, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The countries with very strong evidence of manipulation — RMSE more than 22 — are the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Belarus, Tajikistan, Netherlands, Russia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, South Korea, Colombia, Italy, Turkey, Honduras, Brazil, China, Kuwait, Mexico, Algeria, El Salvador.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My home, India, doesn’t show strong evidence of manipulation (RMSE = 7.32). China (RMSE = 22.6) and Russia (RMSE = 28.9) show major evidence of manipulation. <strong>These results are as on May 23, 2021 and can change in future. Use the app below for live results.</strong></p>
<p>If you are curious about any specific country, I made a Shiny app for each country on live data. Check it out below or <a href="https://harshvardhan.shinyapps.io/covid19benford/" title="Shiny App">here</a>.</p>
<iframe height="900" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://harshvardhan.shinyapps.io/covid19benford/">
</iframe>
<p>The above app takes in live COVID-19 cases data from Our World in Data and analyses using R Shiny. Therefore, the numbers and graphs are updated frequently.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pn6tmOBceBvypNUY537RY0FpWiShsHiwMEjWnFSORaY/edit#gid=0">Here</a> is the complete list of countries and their RMSE values (as of May 31, 2021). The codes for the Shiny app and generating the plots, etc. are included in this Github <a href="https://github.com/harshvardhaniimi/benford-covid-19">repository</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, much detailed analysis is required to conclude anything confidently. Benford’s Law can give misleading conclusions like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-benford/fact-check-deviation-from-benfords-law-does-not-prove-election-fraud-idUSKBN27Q3AI">2020 US Elections</a>, and it might as well be the case here. This is only a first-level analysis. Beyond first-order, expert eyes are required to find how fair is Benford in this case.</p>
