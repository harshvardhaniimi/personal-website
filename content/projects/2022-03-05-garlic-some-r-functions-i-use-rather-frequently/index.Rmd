> Without garlic I simply would not care to ~~live~~ code. --- [Louis Diat](https://twitter.com/kitchenbee/status/991244972501368833)[^1]

[^1]: Louis Diat was a French-American chef. I added the quote because it sounds cool. I called the package `garlic` simply because I love the taste of garlic.

These are some functions that I use very frequently in my projects. There are three categories of functions: exploratory functions to check missing values and describe data, visualisation functions for my ggplot2 themes and manipulative functions to modify selected variables.

# Installing the Package

If you don't have `devtools`, install that first. `devtools` provides the function `install_github()` which can be used to install R packages hosted on Github.

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
```

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("harshvardhaniimi/garlic")
library(garlic)
```

# Exploratory Functions

There are three exploratory functions. This vignette demonstrates how exploratory functions like `show_in_excel()`, `which_na()` and `which_this()` can be used.

```{r setup_1}
library(garlic)
```

## Examples

```{r}
df = iris
```

### Show a data frame in MS Excel

I found this function on Twitter but can't find that tweet anymore. (Update: Bruno Rodrigues created this function. [Here's the tweet](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco/status/1525558786164932611).)

```{r eval = F}
show_in_excel(df)
```

It can also be used with pipes.

```{r eval = F}
library(dplyr)
df %>% 
   show_in_excel()
```

### Which values are missing?

I'm initialising a vector from 1 to 10 with fifth value as missing `NA`.

```{r}
x = c(1:4, NA, 6:10)
```

Using `which_na()`, I can find index of element in the vector which is `NA`.

```{r}
which_na(x)
```

### Which element is this?

It can identify values that satisfy a criteria. It is kind of a wrapper around dplyr's filter().

```{r}
which_this(iris, "Sepal.Length > 7")
```

# Manipulative Functions

There are two mutating functions that modify data frames in a certain way. `na_rm_feature()` is used for removing observations based on a single variable. `na_to_zero()` converts missing values to zero.

```{r setup_2}
library(garlic)
```

## Examples

### Removing Rows Based on Missing Values in a Column

Sometimes, I do not want to `na.omit()` because it will treat all features equally. I want to check values only for one column, while removing those observations.

```{r}
# First ten rows of iris dataset
df = iris[1:10,]
df
# Setting second sepal width to NA
df$Sepal.Width[2] = NA
df
# Removing that observation
df = na_rm_feature(df, "Sepal.Width")
df
```

### Changing Missing Values to Zero

This function converts missing values to zero.

```{r}
# First ten rows of iris dataset
df = iris[1:10,]
df
# Setting second sepal width to NA
df$Sepal.Width[2] = NA
df
```

```{r}
na_to_zero(df$Sepal.Width)
```

# `ggserif()` Theme

I converted axes to directed arrows and made background grid more transparent. In academic publications, serif fonts are often preferred. Thus serif fonts are used.

```{r setup_3}
library(garlic)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
```

This theme upgrades basic `ggplot2` themes. It is particularly suitable for academic publications that require serif fonts for labels and arrowed axes.

### Visually Comparing with Default, Linedraw and Dark Themes

Among the themes available in `ggplot2`, linedraw is my favourite.

```{r}
p1 = iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Default Theme")

p2 = iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "theme_minimal()") +
  theme_linedraw()

p3 = iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "theme_dark()") +
  theme_dark()

p4 = iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "ggserif()") +
  ggserif()
```

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=16}
# Using patchwork, I can easily stitch these plots together.
p1 / p2 / p3 / p4
```

## Setting theme globally

You can set theme globally for all plots using the following command.

```{r}
theme_set(ggserif())
```
