My first academic publication: a peer-reviewed book chapter on statistical modelling using Gaussian processes. We reviewed several GP models and correlation structures, and methods to handle numerical instabilities due to near-singular matrices. Finally, we reviewed several algorithms developed specifically for analysing big data obtained from computer simulators.
