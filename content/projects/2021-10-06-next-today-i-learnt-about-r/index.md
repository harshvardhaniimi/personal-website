Next in my short and sweet newsletter about curated collection on R-related works. It is posted at 9:30 AM (Eastern Time) every Wednesday. The content is pretty straight-forward.

**Five stories. Four packages. Three jargons. Two tweets. One meme.**

# Why I do this?

To learn more about R and statistics, I follow many blogs and people on Twitter. I felt a strong urge to share all I learn with as many people as I could. Blogs had limited readership and were published intermittently. So to bring me to a routine, I started this newsletter. Every Wednesday, I put together some old exciting articles and new impressive innovations in an email sent to more than a hundred learners.

There was a solid latent demand: the letter gained a hundred learners before rolling out the first issue. Several positive reviews are a testimony that people like this. Now, I ask you a favour. Tell me how can I improve this letter. One thing you would like to see and one thing I could do better. Just one.
